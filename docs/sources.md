## Left gastric vein

  - A color Doppler evaluation of the left gastric vein (LGV) has proven utility in the prediction of esophageal varices and variceal bleeding in patients with portal hypertension.

  - Left gastric vein hemodynamics were found to correlate with the severity of the varices and the occurrence of recent variceal bleed in patients with cirrhosis with portal hypertension.

  - Flow direction was hepatopetal in all healthy controls, whereas it was hepatofugal in 72% of the patients with esophageal varices. In the early stage of mild esophageal varices, flow direction was still hepatopetal. However, in portal pressure > 250 mm H2O, hepatofugal flow was highly frequent (56 of 59 patients, 95%). Hepatofugal flow velocity in patients with varices was 8.5 ± 2.5 cm/s in mild varices, 11.6 ± 2.4 cm/s in intermediate varices, and 13.8 ± 3.4 cm/s in marked varices. Variceal bleeding was frequent in patients with a flow velocity > 15 cm/s (7 of 14 patients, 50%).

  - 347 percutaneous transhepatic portal venographic studies were performed on 246 patients with portal hypertension who had had bleeding gastroesophageal varices. Of 234 patients in whom left gastric veins (LGV) (coronary) were demonstrated, 177 (75.6%) had a single LGV and 57 (24.4%) had multiple left gastric veins (21.8% had two LGVs, 2.1% had three LGVs, and 0.5% had five LGVs)... Predominant drainage of esophageal varices was to the azygos vein in 78 of 155 patients, to the hemiazygos vein in 13, and to multiple small unnamed veins in the
mediastinum in 57...

## venous resistance

  - Book chapter, R = 1/Pd^3, Hepatic venous resistance is reduced by 75% in response to an elevation of vena caval pressure of roughly 3 mmHg
